Hi there! I'm thrilled you've found my blog. Let me tell you a bit about myself and what brought me here.

For a decade, I worked in the IT sector, working alongside some of the biggest names in the industry. It was a great ride, but a spark deep down started to flicker. I realized it was time to chase the fire in my belly: becoming a web technology consultant.

This website marks the beginning of that journey. I'm excited to share my expertise through technical blog posts, offering valuable insights into the world of web development.

While I have a deep fondness for PHP and Laravel, I'm also eager to explore the potential of static websites. That's why I built this platform using Jekyll. I have built this site by keeping it minimalist in my mind so that it keeps distractions at bay, allowing you to focus on the content.

The hard work I've poured into this blog so that it would help web designers community in some way. I hope the information you find here proves to be a helpful resource.
